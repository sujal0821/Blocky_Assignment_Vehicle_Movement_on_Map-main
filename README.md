Vehicle Movement on Map
This project simulates the movement of a vehicle on a map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The vehicle's path is dynamically updated on the map, offering a smooth, interactive visualization of its movement. It's a great tool for showcasing vehicle tracking systems or learning how to work with geolocation, animations, and maps in web development.
